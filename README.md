### Hi there 👋

I'm Russell

And I'm a full-stack developer at Thornton Tomasetti in CORE Studio, where I work on building web and desktop applications for different structural engineering departments in the company.

Here are some things I am working on:

- 👨‍💻 At TT I am working in C# developing new graph traversal methods for buildings, and automated steel connection and design modeling software.
- 🦫 At School (graduated in 2023) I've been working on building a GCP app with authentication, a public Zillow API game w/ JavaScript technologies, and a private trading optimization platform to optimize different algorithms that utilize momentum stragtegies to beat the market
- 🏒 Fun fact: I like to play hockey in the cold
